We are a small group from URJC university in Spain and we are doing this web app for Web Aplications Development.  
**We will be working on a videoclub. The costumers will be able to buy or rent films, videogames and series.**  

# Phase 1  
In this phase we will show you the entities of the database and the advanced functionalities of our project.  
We will show several graphs too, like a sales graph, with the best-selling products and a graph with the most valued products.  
We also will integrate a facebook page that will contain information about the products and exclusive offers.
