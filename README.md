# Phase 2  
In this phase, we will show you the layouts for our web. We have made only the HTML and CSS implementation.

These are the screens that we have created:  
  
* Main screen[index]: This screen will be displayed when starting the web page. Here, you can choose between games, movies
and series section. Also, you can go to our facebook page by clicking the "Facebook" button, or log in for start renting.

# Phase 3

In this phase, we have implemented the app with functionality in Spring. If you want to run it, you have to import the project in your Spring Tool Suite, and run as Spring boot application.
Once the application is started, you have to write this in your browser to accede our app: "https://localhost:8443".

We have made some changes in our view, and we have created some other news. Here are the pictures of these changes:
