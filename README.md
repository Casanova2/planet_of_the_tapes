We are a small group from URJC university in Spain and we are doing this web app for Web Aplications Development.  
**We will be working on a videoclub. The costumers will be able to buy or rent films, videogames and series.**  

# Phase 1  
In this phase we will show you the entities of the database, the external technologies that will be used and the advanced functionalities of our project.

# Phase 2  
In this phase, we will make the HMTL and CSS layout for our web. For the CSS implementation, we have  
used a template from this page (insert URL).  

These are the screens that we have created:  
  
* Main screen: This screen will be displayed when starting the web page. Here, you can choose between games, movies
and series section. Also, you can go to our facebook page by clicking the "Facebook" button, or log in for 
start renting.

* Product List screen: In this screen, we can see the product list depends on series, movies or videogames.

* Product screen: In this screen, you can see a detailed description of the product you have chosen before.  
(series, movies or games). If you are logged, you can start the rent of the product.
